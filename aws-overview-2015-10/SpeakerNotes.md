# Intro
* Markus - first used AWS for Data Science MOOC in 2013 (EMR)
* Several AWS classes later...

# Amazon Web Services: AWS
* Started in 2006
    * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
    * Simple Storage Service (S3)
    * [Amazon EC2 history @clark_how_2012]
* By 2010: Amazon.com retail web services mostly moved to AWS
* 2015: Over a Million Active Customers in 190 Countries
    * e.g. Netflix, Dropbox, Airbnb, Supercell (Clash of Clans, Hay Day, Boom Beach)

# Amazon Web Services (AWS) In the News

Wired Magazine July 2015

Amazon has figured out how to make cloud pay

> $391 million profit based on $1.82 billion in revenue. Thatâ€™s a
> 407 percent increase in profit from the year before, and an
> 81 percent bump in revenue.

# Gartner: Infrastructure As A Service Magic Quadrant
* X-axis: Completeness of vision
* Y-axis: Ability to execute
* Four quadrants: Niche players, visionaries, challengers, leaders
* Other providers: Rackspace, Google, Microsoft - trying to catch up

# AWS Regions and Edge Points of Presence
* 10 public, 2 US government regions
     * AWS GovCloud
* Each region: 3 or more Availability Zones (~ each AZ is 1 or more independent data centers)
     * AZs connected with private fiber in a 50m radius < 1ms latency
* Points of Presence - edge nodes for content delivery network (CloudFront - cache)
* How much overall? "Every day, AWS installs enough server infrastructure to host the entire
   Amazon e-tailing business from back in 2004" [700 million dollar revenue - Rare Peek into Massive Scale of AWS @morgan_rare_2014]

# Multiplayer Mobile Game Application
* Start-up: Mobile device, backend server and database
* Show to investors, Minimum Viable Product

# Scaling Up - Getting Beefy
* Scaling up/Scale vertically - bigger equipment (sell old or use for testing)
* Must provision for peak demand? - must scale horizontally

# Scaling Out/Horizontal, Content Delivery Network & Analytics
* Scale horizontal, load balancer
* Backend to NoSQL - better scaling and no fixed schema (evolutionary architecture)
* User experience - forward deploy with CDN
* Batch and realtime analytics, datawarehouse for business analysts

# Redundant Environments
* Development
* Testing
* Production
     * DevOps - Blue/Green Deployments?
     * Disaster recovery (somebody didn't call Miss Utility)

# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* Must provision for peak demand/Good Morning America
* Instead of capital expense - operating expense
* Multiple regions/Availability Zones (AZs)
* EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
     * Elastic Load Balancer service (no single point of failure)
     * Auto-scaling group - up/down (pay only for what is used)
* Route 53 - Blue/Green deployments (DNS server - also DR)

# Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache
* Administering database is hard - RDS (redundancy, backups, read replicas)
* DynamoDB - NoSQL Key/Value store with attributes (provisioned service)
* ElastiCache Service - Redis or Memcached (faster repsonse times)

# Amazon CloudFront CDN, S3
* CloudFront CDN - serve static content from Points of Presence - read S3, cache
* Simple Storage Service - Scalable Key, object store 1 byte to 5TB per object
     * Can use S3 as input to Elastic MapReduce Hadoop job!
     * Buckets, store key/objects
     * 11 9s of durability (99.999999999) - lose two facilities
     * 4 9s of availability (99.99) - 52.56 minutes per year
     * SSL and automatic encryption
     * Storage classes: General Purpose, Infrequent Access (IA), Glacier (hours to access)

# Amazon Scalable Analytics - Batch, Streaming, Datawarehouse
* Elastic MapReduce (EMR) - Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Pig, Hue, Zeppelin against S3, RedShift...
     * Priced by the hour! Linear scaling - double instances?
* Kinesis Streaming - think managed Kafka? real-time analytics, scalable ETL
* RedShift - Datawarehouse, columnar, fast, petabyte-scale (1000/TB/year)

# Security At Every Layer
* Identity & Access Management (IAM) - Amazon infrastructure/services
* Users, groups, roles, rich policies/conditions
* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - subnets w/ Network Access Control Lists, route
tables, network gateways
* EC2 - Security groups (like iptables firewall)
* Web Application Firewall
* CloudTrail - all AWS service access logged
* CloudWatch - Monitor, alarm - e.g. auto-scaling up/down

# Compute As A Service
* Sys admin - hard, deploy web apps via Elastic Beanstalk
* Short running code? React to environment/change/time - Lambda
* Lambda: 1 to 5 minutes (Python, Java, Node.js/JavaScript)
* Pricing: per 100 ms
* API Gateway - invoke Lambda from web URL

# 52 AWS Services
* Simple Queuing Service, SNS
* Simple Workflow Service (SWF)
* CloudFormation

# EC2 Instances
* On Demand
* Reserved 1-3 years, up to 75% off on demand
* Reserved Instance Marketplace
* Spot Instances - up to 90% on excess, may lose if demand goes up or outbid

# Infrastructure As Code - RESTful via Management Console
* All service endpoints are REST endpoints
* GUI frontend to configure services

# Infrastructure As Code - RESTful via AWS CLI
* Command line interface with Python boto backend to REST endpoints
* Script start up/shutdown, make repeatable, can version

# Infrastructure As Code - RESTful via AWS SDKs
* Software Dev Kits for many languages
* Use in program to communicate with services securely
* Tonight: AWS Java SDK

# Infrastructure As Code - CloudFormation JSON
* Export existing setup to different region
* Version-controlled, auditable infrastructure (no router, hardware)

# AWS Marketplace
* Get instances with configured software
* Try out, pay by the hour with option to rent for year
* Preconfigured, installed, license (or bring your own)

  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI DSS), regular updates by AWS
  Security researchers
