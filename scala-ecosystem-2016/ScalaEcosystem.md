% The Scala programming ecosystem
% Leveraging functional, OO, libraries and frameworks
% Markus Dale, 2016

# Scala to Java bytecode
* Leverage Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
     * Over 20 years of optimizations
     * Java Interpreter and Just-in-time (JIT) compilers
     * Portability and Security
     * Ever-evolving garbage collectors
* Full interoperability with Java and Java libraries

# Functional Programming
* Computation as mathematical functions
     * Function outcome depends only on arguments, idempotent invocations
* Avoid state changes and mutable data structures
* Declarative programming style - expressions
* Functions are first-class
* Can have higher-order functions - take or return functions
* Pure functions - no side effects
